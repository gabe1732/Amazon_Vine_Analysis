# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of vine review analysis.  
The purpose of this analysis was to look at a large dataset of amazon reviews.  We wanted look at individual products and see how many times they were reviewed, what rating they on their review(star base review) and if the Vine reviews provided a more positive review vs a non-vine review.   
   
## Results of the Amazon vine review analysis
- There was a total of 960,872 reviews. Only 1,747 were vine reviews and the remaining 959,125 were non-vine reviews.
- Total 5 star reviews were 571,627; only 605 of those were vine reviews.
- Of the total non vine reviews 60% were 5 star reviews.  While only 35% of the vine reviews were 5 star reveiws.

          
      
 ## Summary 
 It does not look like the vine reviews had a positive influence on the product ratings since they only accounted for .182% of the total reviews.  with close to a    million reviews even if all of the vine reviews were 5 star reviews would not skew the results much.
